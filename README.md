NPOI - .NET Core Support
===================

**We are working on NPOI .NET Core version. Since .NET Core 2.1 is stable enough, we decide to migrate NPOI to .NET core.**

This project is the .NET version of POI Java project. With NPOI, you can read/write Office 2003/2007 files very easily.<br />

How to use NPOI in Linux
======================
According to [Scott's post](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowDoYouUseSystemDrawingInNETCore.aspx), you must install the following libraries before using NPOI. 
```
sudo apt install libc6-dev 
sudo apt install libgdiplus
```
